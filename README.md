The project aims to develop an efficient brain tumor detection system using machine learning models, specifically Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classification (SVC). Brain tumor detection is crucial for early diagnosis and effective treatment. We will utilize a dataset containing MRI images of the brain to train and evaluate our models.

The Logistic Regression model will be employed to classify brain MRI images into tumor or non-tumor categories based on relevant features extracted from the images. Logistic Regression's probabilistic nature makes it suitable for binary classification tasks.

Furthermore, we will implement the Support Vector Classification (SVC) model, known for its capability to find optimal decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces. This model will help classify brain MRI images by determining the best hyperplane that separates tumor from non-tumor instances.

Our project will involve data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation. We will utilize common evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the models' performance.

By combining the strengths of Logistic Regression and SVC, we intend to create a robust brain tumor detection system that can aid medical professionals in making accurate and timely diagnoses, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.
